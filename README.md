In this project, I developed a machine learning model using Anaconda Navigator, leveraging Jupyter Notebook and Python. The dataset consisted of individuals' age and gender information. I created a predictive model that recommends music preferences based on these demographic factors. This project aimed to correlate age, gender, and musical taste, demonstrating the potential of machine learning in personalization and recommendation systems
